6. Click the `Delete` button next to an asset to remove unwanted assets.

## Whitelist
The whitelist feature allows users to exclude certain assets or folders from detection. Whitelist information is stored in the `Whitelist.asset` scriptable object located in the ```Assets/UnusedAssetsDetector/```.

## Notes
- Use the delete function with caution, as deleted assets cannot be recovered.
- The demo assets are using Unity's built-in render pipeline
